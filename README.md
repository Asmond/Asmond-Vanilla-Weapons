[code]✔️ THIS MOD ADDS [b]+150 CUSTOM MADE RETEXTURES TO DAYZ'S VANILLA WEAPONS[/b] TO OFFER GREATER DIVERSITY AND LOOT CUSTOMIZATION FOR PLAYERS AND SERVER OWNERS.[/code]
[code]✅ THIS IS MY FIRST MOD, SO MY GOAL WITH IT IS TO KEEP LEARNING WHILE CONTRIBUTING WITH SOMETHING THAT I HOPE IT HAS ENOUGH QUALITY TO BE USED. I AM COMPLETELY OPEN TO YOUR FEEDBACK, SUGGESTIONS AND/OR TO ADDRESS ANY ERRORS YOU MAY FIND.[/code]
[code]✅ THE INTENTION IS FOR THESE WEAPONS TO LOOK AND FEEL VANILLA. ALL THE RETEXTURES WERE MADE WITH THAT APROACH. EACH RETEXTURE / WEAPON WAS DONE INDIVIDUALLY WITH SPECIAL ATTENTION TO DETAIL, ALSO ADDING ATTACHMENTS AND MAGAZINES TO ENSURE THE BEST AESTHETIC CONSISTENCY.[/code]
[code]✅ THE INSPIRATION FOR THE RETEXTURES WAS MAINLY REAL VERSIONS OF THE WEAPONS, AS WELL AS CERTAIN REFERENCES OF POPULAR GAMES WITHIN THE SURVIVAL/APOCALYPTIC GENRE (STALKER, METRO AND OTHERS).[/code]
