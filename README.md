# Asmond – Vanilla Weapons

**Asmond – Vanilla Weapons** adds **150+ custom-made retextures** to DayZ vanilla weapons, providing greater visual diversity and loot customization while preserving the original vanilla feel.

All retextures are designed to integrate seamlessly into the base game, making them suitable for both players and server owners who want more variety without breaking immersion.

## 🧠 About the Mod

- This is **my first DayZ mod**, and its main goal is learning while contributing something useful and high quality to the community.
- I am **completely open to feedback, suggestions, and bug reports**.
- Every weapon and retexture was made **individually**, with special attention to:
  - Visual consistency
  - Attachments
  - Magazines
  - Vanilla balance and aesthetics

## 🎯 Design Philosophy

- The mod is intended to **look and feel 100% vanilla**.
- Retextures are inspired by:
  - Real-world weapon variants
  - Popular survival / apocalyptic games  
    *(S.T.A.L.K.E.R., Metro, and similar titles)*

The goal is to **enrich the vanilla experience** without altering gameplay mechanics.
